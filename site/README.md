# OHDSI Open Source Community

The OHDSI Open Source Community is a group builders who are passionate about the health and sustainability of the OHDSI open source software ecosystem.   We meet monthly in the OHDSI Teams environment and work together asynchronously on Github.

&#x20;

## Pillars&#x20;

1. Education and community events for all OHDSI software contributors&#x20;
2. Documentation of standard interfaces and processes &#x20;
3. Monitoring of metrics of open source community health and sustainability&#x20;
4. Maturing open source software governance using best practices from other communities&#x20;
5. Support the maintainers of OHDSI core software with infrastructure needs&#x20;
